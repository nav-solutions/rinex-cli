Final CPP
=========

The CPP navigation technique uses two pseudo range codes to cancel ionospheric bias.  
Once two signals (two carrier frequencies) have been sampled for a single SV, any ionosphere modeling
and other cancellation option is automatically disabled: we always prefer phyisical cancellation.
